"longDescription":"An all-star cast, including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich, come together in this outrageous spy comedy about murder, blackmail, sex addiction and physical fitness! When a disc filled with some of the CIA's most irrelevant secrets gets in the hands of two determined, but dim-witted, gym employees, the duo are intent on exploiting their find. But since blackmail is a trade better left for the experts, events soon spiral out of everyone's and anyone's control, resulting in a non-stop series of hilarious encounters! From Joel and Ethan Coen, the Academy Award®-winning directors of No Country For Old Men and The Big Lebowski, comes this brilliantly clever and endlessly entertaining movie that critics are calling, \"smart, funny, and original\" (Ben Lyons, E!)."},

"longDescription":"Academy Award® nominees Bill Murray and Laura Linney star in this delightful look at one of the most pivotal meetings in history. As Great Britain faces an imminent war with Germany, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Murray) and his wife, Eleanor (Olivia Williams), invite the King and Queen of England for a weekend at their home in upstate New York. But during the first-ever visit of a reigning British monarch to America, international affairs must be juggled with the complexities of FDR’s domestic establishment, as wife, mother, and mistresses all conspire to make the royal trip an unforgettable one. Hyde Park of Hudson is a charming and fresh look at true events and the mysteries of love and friendship, from the acclaimed director of Notting Hill."},
