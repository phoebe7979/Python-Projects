this is a file with a lot of contents in it
it also has multiple lines but there are some words that are more common than others
i mean, extremely common really very common words
obviously there is a reason for certain structures here for your python practice
purposes
but some words are more common than others in most documents
common common common common_word
that last is more like a variable than a normal english word for example but python will still count it as a common word or an uncommon word the way we count
definitely some words are more common than other ones are
there exist files that will be more common and more interesting than this one
but this will serve for regular ol' common file practice
