Beneath the snow and a thin crust of ice, you could poke through to water. But below that was a big thick layer of ice. I crossed on Sunday with Max and one of his friends.Inspired by that, two days this week, I strapped on x-country skis, skied up river on the ice, under the railroad bridge and into the Arboretum.  I carried my skis once I reached campus. Felt very Canadian, or perhaps Norwegian, skiing to work.,P Resnick,5,106

2014-02-13T18:45:17+0000,What a great adventure.  Reminds me of our first winter on South Pond when it froze but we didn't know if it was safe.  So we went out on it with a huge coil of rope in case one of us fell in.  In the spring we found out the where we were walking was about 1.5 feet deep, ....so we wouldn't have drowned anyway.  I love the river.,J Orson,1,69

Glad to say it didn't happen! I know it sounds crazy to say it, but this has been the best winter ever here.,P Resnick,2,52
